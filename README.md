# AV

A experimental Ruby Programmable interface for FFmpeg. This is *not* a general
replacement for the upstream parent Gem!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'av'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install av

## Usage

The gem provides programmable interface for ffmpeg and avconv.
The idea is to have a common API for both CLIs.
